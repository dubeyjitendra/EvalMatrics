# EvalMatrics

Understand the Low level coding implementation of supervised machine learning Matrcis


the most common metrics used for classification problems:
- Accuracy
- Precision (P)
- Recall (R)
- F1 score (F1)
- Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve or simply AUC (AUC)
- Log loss
- Precision at k (P@k)
- Average precision at k (AP@k)
- Mean average precision at k (MAP@k)

When it comes to regression, the most commonly used evaluation metrics are:
- Mean absolute error (MAE)
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE)
- Mean percentage error (MPE)
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- R2
